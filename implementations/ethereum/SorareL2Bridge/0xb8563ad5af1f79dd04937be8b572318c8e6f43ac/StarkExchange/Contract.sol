An address of an external initialization contract (optional, or ZERO_ADDRESS).\n      III. (Up to) N bytes sections of the sub-contracts initializers.\n\n      If already initialized (i.e. upgrade) we expect the init data to be consistent with this.\n      and if a different size of init data is expected when upgrading, the initializerSize should\n      reflect this.\n\n      If an external initializer contract is not used, ZERO_ADDRESS is passed in its slot.\n      If the external initializer contract is used, all the remaining init data is passed to it,\n      and internal initialization will not occur.\n\n      External Initialization Contract\n      --------------------------------\n      External Initialization Contract (EIC) is a hook for custom initialization.\n      Typically in an upgrade flow, the expected initialization contains only the addresses of\n      the sub-contracts. Normal initialization of the sub-contracts is such that is not needed\n      in an upgrade, and actually may be very dangerous, as changing of state on a working system\n      may corrupt it.\n\n      In the event that some state initialization is required, the EIC is a hook that allows this.\n      It may be deployed and called specifically for this purpose.\n\n      The address of the EIC must be provided (if at all) when a new implementation is added to\n      a Proxy contract (as part of the initialization vector).\n      Hence, it is considered part of the code open to reviewers prior to a time-locked upgrade.\n\n      When a custom initialization is performed using an EIC,\n      the main dispatcher initialize extracts and stores the sub-contracts addresses, and then\n      yields to the EIC, skipping the rest of its initialization code.\n\n\n      Flow of MainDispatcher initialize\n      ---------------------------------\n      1. Extraction and assignment of subcontracts addresses\n         Main dispatcher expects a valid and consistent set of addresses in the passed data.\n         It validates that, extracts the addresses from the data, and validates that the addresses\n         are of the expected type and order. Then those addresses are stored.\n\n      2. Extraction of EIC address\n         The address of the EIC is extracted from the data.\n         External Initializer Contract is optional. ZERO_ADDRESS indicates it is not used.\n\n      3a. EIC is used\n          Dispatcher calls the EIC initialize function with the remaining data.\n          Note - In this option 3b is not performed.\n\n      3b. EIC is not used\n          If there is additional initialization data then:\n          I. Sentitenl function is called to permit subcontracts initialization.\n          II.
