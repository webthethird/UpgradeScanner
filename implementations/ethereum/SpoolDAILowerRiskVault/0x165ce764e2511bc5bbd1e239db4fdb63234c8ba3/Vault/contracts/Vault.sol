 * @notice Implementation of the {IVault} interface.
 *
 * @dev
 * All vault instances are meant to be deployed via the Controller
 * as a proxy and will not be recognizable by the Spool if they are
 * not done so.
 *
 * The vault contract is capable of supporting a single currency underlying
 * asset and deposit to multiple strategies at once, including dual-collateral
 * ones.
 *
 * The vault also supports the additional distribution of extra reward tokens as
 * an incentivization mechanism proportionate to each user's deposit amount within
 * the vhe vault.
 *
 * Vault implementation consists of following contracts:
 * 1. VaultImmutable: reads vault specific immutable variable from vault proxy contract
 * 2. VaultBase: holds vault state variables and provides some of the common vault functions
 * 3. RewardDrip: distributes vault incentivized rewards to users participating in the vault
 * 4. VaultIndexActions: implements functions to synchronize the vault with central Spool contract
 * 5. VaultRestricted: exposes functions restricted for other Spool specific contracts
 * 6. Vault: exposes unrestricted functons to interact with the core vault functionality (deposit/withdraw/claim)

     * calling central Spool contract will revert. This function must be called,

     * to the new strategy array.

     *
     * - The Spool system must finish reallocation if it's in progress
     * - the provided strategies must be valid
     * - The strategy must belong to this vault
     * - The strategy must be removed from the system
     *
     * @param vaultStrategies Array of current vault strategies (including the removed one)
     * @param i Index of the removed strategy in the `vaultStrategies`
