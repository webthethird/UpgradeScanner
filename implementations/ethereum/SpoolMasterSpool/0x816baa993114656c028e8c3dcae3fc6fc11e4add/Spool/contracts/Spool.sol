 * The Spool implementation is the central part of the system.

 * Spool implementation consists of following contracts:
 * 1. BaseStorage: stores common variables with all the strategy adapters (they are execuret as delegatecode)
 * 2. SpoolBase: holds Spool state variables and provides some of the common vault functions
 * 3. SpoolStrategy: implements the logic of how to interact with the strategies
 * 4. SpoolDoHardWork: implements functions to process the do hard work
 * 5. SpoolReallocation: adjusts vault reallocation that takes place at the next do hard work
 * 6. SpoolExternal: exposes functons to interact with the Spool from the vault (deposit/withdraw/redeem)
 * 7. Spool: implements a constructor to deploy a contracts
