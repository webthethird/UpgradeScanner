/** @notice Handle setting zero value in a storage word as uint128 max value.
  *
  *  @dev
  *  The purpose of this is to avoid resetting a storage word to the zero value; 
  *  the gas cost of re-initializing the value is the same as setting the word originally.
  *  so instead, if word is to be set to zero, we set it to uint128 max.
  *
  *   - anytime a word is loaded from storage: call "get"
  *   - anytime a word is written to storage: call "set"
  *   - common operations on uints are also bundled here.
  *
  * NOTE: This library should ONLY be used when reading or writing *directly* from storage.
